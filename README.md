## Project Overview

With regards to the project I attempted to go with unique looking buttons with inspiration from: [View Reference](https://codepen.io/codespace-academy/pen/xxmWrjX). 
I tried to make the buttons stand out and chose ones with various animations to get experience creating different animations and syles.
I had trouble getting the last button to work and functin properly, as I think it overlapped the previous button. I tried to copy the 12th button from the reference, however it did not display. Could not fix it in time for 
submission so I changed button design.
I will continue to play around and attempt to get it working.
